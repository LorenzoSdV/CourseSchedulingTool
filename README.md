# FinalProject_3110

In degree_reqs/Eng_CS.json is what I am thinking for our JSON files specifying
degree requirements. It's not complete but hopefully you get the gist.



*Note from Chris:* I fucked around with Makefile and should now run "make build"
as long as everything is working. I moved all the files that are causing problems
into the "Xtra Stuff" folder. These either don't do anything useful for us or 
need to be seriously re-written. Probably not worth doing.
